# basic-android-app
Welcome to the Public Repository for my First Basic Android App!

I am a Python and Java developer trying my hand at developing an Android app for the first time. I am following along on android.developer.com (source: https://developer.android.com/codelabs/build-your-first-android-app)

##### If you see any code you like, or you think needs improvement, feel free to create a pull request! I enjoy collaborating so any and all feedback is welcome!
